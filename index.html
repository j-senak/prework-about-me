      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a student web developer, trying to make my way downtown. I'm walking fast, the day is past and I'm home now.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Ann Arbor, MI. Moved to Fremont, IN when I was in middle school. I moved to Atlanta 6 years ago to try the city life and so far it has been great!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Music has been a passion of mine for many years. I play bass currently, but would love to buy a saxophone to start playing again. When I am not doing that, I enjoy playing Magic: The Gathering with friends and staying in touch with my old friends with video games.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Any job where I can challenge myself and grow. A job where I can enjoy the work I put in and the people around me.</p>

      <p>I currently live in West Midtown not far away from GA Tech.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer to improve my career and education with something I can enjoy. I believe it will make my overall enjoyment in life much better.</p>
